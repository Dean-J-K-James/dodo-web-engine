<h1>Introduction to Cellular Automata</h1>

            <div class="cell flex-col flex-16 p-16 blog"><h2>What are Cellular Automata?</h2>
<p>A cellular automaton (plural: cellular automata), or CA, is an n-dimensional grid of cells, each in one of m possible states. This grid can be visualised, as shown by <em>Figure 1</em>. This example shows a 16x8 two-dimensional cellular automaton, where cells are coloured either black or white, each representing one of two states.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Cellular automata by themselves are just a static grid and don't do anything. However, when a set of rules are applied, cells change based on their state, and the states of their neighbours.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous cellular automaton is Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is an outer-totalistic CA in a two-dimensional grid, uses a Moore neighbourhood, and has two possible states for each cell. More on what these features mean will be explained throughout this article.</p>
<h2>Cell States</h2>
<p>Cellular automata consist of cells, each in one of <code>m</code> possible states, where <code>m</code> is a finite integer. When visualised, cells can be coloured according to their state.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/contents/cellular-automata-introduction/figure2.png" alt="One-Dimensional Cellular Automata" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - One-Dimensional Cellular Automata.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Figure 2</em> shows a one-dimensional CA of size 11, with a value of <code>m = 3</code>, meaning each cell can be in one of three states. Cells in state 0 are coloured white, cells in state 1 are coloured grey, and cells in state 2 are coloured black.</p>
<p>In memory, cells are usually represented by integers in a n-dimensional array, where <code>n</code> is the number of dimensions of the CA. Since the example in <em>Figure 2</em> is a one-dimensional CA, we use a one-dimensional array to store it's cell states. The array would look like this: <code>{20102210100}</code>.</p>
<p>To make it easier to distinguish states, they are often given labels. For example, in a CA with two possible states, labels include: true and false, on and off, or live and dead.</p>
<h2>Generations</h2>
<p>A single instance/ snapshot of a CA, with each cell having a state, is called a generation. <em>Figure 1</em> could be considered a single generation of a two-dimensional CA. Cellular automata become useful when a set of rules are applied to them. These rules cause the states of each cell to change, and when applied to every cell, will produce a new generation.</p>
<p>Comparisons between consecutive generations allow programmers to evaluate and observe different patterns. For example, the four generations in <em>Figure 3</em> show the so-called "blinker" pattern found in Conway's Game of Life.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/contents/cellular-automata-introduction/figure3.png" alt="Four Generations of a 3x3 CA" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> - Four Generations of a 3x3 CA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This type of pattern is called an oscillator pattern, because over the course of several generations, the states of each cell oscillate.</p>
<p>If we assume that the first example in <em>Figure 3</em> is the initial state of our CA, then we would label is as the first generation, or <code>generation = 0</code>. If we then apply a set of rules to every cell in the first generation, the resulting grid will be the second generation, or <code>generation = 1</code>.</p>
<p>The generation tells us how many times a cell has had the rules applied to it. If the initial state of the grid is <code>generation = 0</code>, this means no rules have yet been applied. For <code>generation = 1</code>, every cell has been evaluated against the rules once. For <code>generation = 45</code>, every cell has had the rules applied to it 45 times.</p></div>
